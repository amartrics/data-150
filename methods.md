## Quantifying Gendered Unfreedoms: Proposed Methodologies for the Resolution of the Gender Data Gap and the Enumeration of Female Wellbeing

### Introduction 

Along the path towards human flourishing and development, a tenuous balance often arises between culture and progress. Though these two processes can exist in harmony, allowing for the cultivation of a well-functioning, socially-minded society, danger rears its head when the progression of one impedes on the other – development itself depends entirely on the growth of human capabilities. When tradition begins to impinge upon the freedoms of minority groups, there is no longer leeway for historic norms to continually dictate the day-to-day life of an entire population. In recent decades, this conflict between preservation and developmental progression has risen in prominence as a topic of interest for development experts and data scientists in Southeast Asia, where longstanding patriarchal precepts dominate women’s social interactions, educational opportunities, economic activity, access to healthcare, political engagement, and human security. A brief examination of South Asia’s employment rates shows there is a shockingly low percentage (only about 20%) of female workers in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh [1], with a significant number of women “overrepresented” in low-paying jobs that place them below the average median incomes accorded to their home countries [2]. Economic opportunities have been historically linked to mental health benefits; people with the freedom to pursue their own occupations report, on average, a higher sense of fulfillment, structure, and social engagement [3] in their day-to-day lives. Southeast Asian women barred from the workplace suffer, then, not only as a result of lacking control over fiscal resources, but also from the psychological effects of social isolation and domestic expectations of submission. Thus, the cycle of gender discrimination is compounded: female children are viewed as economic burdens from birth because it is expected that they will not engage in economic activity, which further encourages the undervaluation of girls & women as a homogenous group. 

While Southeast Asian women undeniably experience a notable decrease in wellbeing (and, according to a 2008 medical study on the role of gender in health disparity, a negation of the female “biological advantage” [4]) as a result of these linked phenomena, the rest of the region’s population suffers as well. When half of any populace is prevented from engaging in economic activity, the whole will predictably reap fewer benefits than those generated by an integrated workforce. But with significant gaps in gender-disaggregated data on economic, physical, and mental health in areas like Northern India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, it is difficult to determine the true extent of gender inequality in the area. A substantial foundation of cross-tabulable, granular, high-quality, and high-coverage data is necessary to understand these countries’ progress towards gender-focused SDGs, especially as they relate to economic opportunities and female health & well-being. New research and the testing of cutting-edge technologies suggests it is possible to create such a database by synthesizing priori from existing surveys with novel mapping techniques. Data imaging produced by a combination of Bayesian generalized linear models, artificial neural networks, and repeated cross-validation processes as well as the addition of a “gender layer” to tried-and-true G.I.S. imaging could be particularly useful in generating accurate representations of social, health, and economic phenomena across both tiny pockets and large swathes of land [5]. Using these methods in tandem, an answer may be found to the following question: *how do the developmental processes of human wellbeing, economic growth, and the furthering of gender equity in Southeast Asia impact one another, and how can we quantify and better understand the links between them on a scale of enumerable indices?*

### Inquiry Type and Sub-CRQs 

Before solutions to Southeast Asia’s massive wage gaps, poor rates of political participation and representation amongst women, belittled scholastic expectations and opportunities for girls, and the female population’s lacking access to healthcare – especially in regards to sexual and mental health – are even proposed, it is vital to gain a complete and realistic understanding of spatially-diverse gender inequity. This goal can only be accomplished through an explanatory strain of inquiries that focuses on the underlying causes and predictive attributes of gender-based phenomena. Beyond identifying what is happening in terms of disaggregation in a single region’s realms of economic activity, educational opportunity, and general wellbeing, it is crucial that data scientists and development experts utilize a comparative approach to analyzing localized data, allowing for the comprehension of “why events take place; why things happen as they do; how things happen; and what… processes [are] involved” [6]. In the context of Southeast Asia’s progress towards the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal 5, which aims to “[end] all discrimination against women and girls” [7], this line of questioning necessitates investigating the motivations of gender inequity in modernity, including the contemporary incarnations of patriarchal norms in the workplace, healthcare centers, and stratified social settings. To enumerate this kind of qualitative data and create scalable, predictive models of both regional and global progress towards gendered development as proposed by the central research question of this paper, several questions must be answered. Firstly, *how do variations between localized economic and health phenomena on a global level relate to scaled differences of gender inequity? How can scaling inform our understanding of complex, gender-based phenomena?* Secondly, *what are the observable effects of unresolved social inequities, such as gender inequality, on overall population health and country-wide fiscal growth?* And finally, *how can the disaggregation of preexisting data and the implementation of more equitable analytical tools, such as granular, satellite-based G.I.S. imaging and predictive modelling performed by neural networks, change our understanding of gender inequality as a quantitative measure of social progress?*

### Computational Descriptions (Applied Bayesian Generalized Linear Modelling & Geographic Information Systems) 

In attempting to crack the “comparative puzzle” posed by the interconnectivity of gender-based phenomena in regions that are dominated by patriarchal cultural influences typically described in qualitative terms (e.g., Southeast Asia), it is critical that as little bias as possible is included in the process of data analysis. At the same time, however, interpreting markers of physical wellbeing, such as those indicated by rates of infectious disease contraction, malnourishment, and child stunting, is futile without a proper framework with which to examine these data. Both of these approaches – one, purely empirical in its disregard for hypothesizing, and the other, determined to preserve the three preexisting, theory-based paradigms of science described by Rob Kitchin in his article “Big Data, new epistemologies and paradigm shifts” [8] – need to be incorporated into the analysis of human development problems, lest important qualitative aspects of data of interest are lost in the translation of observed facts to crunchable figures. By considering these contextual elements of data science before applying impartial computational methods to complex, localized development problems, it may be possible to identify combinations of data mapping, machine learning, and algorithm-based systems that can cater to the specific challenges posed by the enumeration of these qualitative problems. 
In the case of calculating gender inequity in Southeast Asia, two specific methodologies that could provide definitively quantitative answers to the central research question of this paper come to mind: applied Bayesian generalized linear modelling and layered geographic information systems. 

Originally developed as a solution to a problem of inverse probability in the 18th century, British statistician Thomas Bayes’ theorem of “Bayesian probability” has since evolved to meet the demands of geospatial plotting projects and survey-based studies on human development. Though it is regarded as “one of the most theoretically and computationally challenging problems encountered in practice” [9], it is also recognized as an incredibly accurate and efficient form of predictive modelling. In the simplest of terms, the Bayesian modelling approach utilizes a combination of prior – recorded knowledge and data – and likelihood – inferring which value of an unknown parameter is most likely to generate the data on record – to calculate the posterior distribution of a productive input. This technique is considered an extension of linear mixed and generalized linear models, as it considers “dependent variables from [non-normal] distributions” as well as “both fixed and random” outcomes [10]. The actual equation involved with this process relies on the connection of a random, or stochastic, component with a separate, systemic component through a link function of θ. This can all be represented as a function in the form P(θ|D) = (P(D|θ) X P(θ))/P(D), wherein P(θ) stands for the prior, (P(D|θ) stands for the likelihood of a result given the distribution of θ, P(D) stands for the probability of a certain data point, and P(θ|D) stands for the posterior parameters determined by the equation’s result [11]. </div>

In 2017, a group of researchers funded by a subsidized foundation of the United Nations, Data2x, developed a modelling technique able to create “gender-disaggregated high-resolution maps” [5] of Kenya, Tanzania, Bangladesh, and Nigeria using a combination of Bayesian generalized linear models, artificial neural networks, and repeated cross-validation processes. Their method of applied Bayesian modelling was able to accurately identify and predict instances of social, health, wealth, and resource-based inequity amongst the female population of Southeast Asia. Instead of relying on nationwide surveys and simplified census data, the high-resolution mapping of development indicators combines geospatial covariates with correlating, pre-established data pools to more accurately predict social, health, and economic phenomena in both tiny pockets and large swathes of land. Though there are some drawbacks associated with the use of this method, C. Bosco and his team managed to chart literacy, stunting, contraception use, and income rates on various geographic scales with a relatively small margin of error “in the range of 2-30% explained variance…” – variance largely attributed to gaps in the project’s original referential datasets [5]. For instance, the high-resolution map of Bangladesh produced by this method was able to display the geographic clustering of women with little to no education alongside geospatial concentrations of stunted children, concisely linking two distinctive indicators of development. Seeing as how almost 40% of Bangladesh’s population under the age of 5 are reported to have stunted growth – and considering that children with uneducated mothers “are more than twice as likely to be short for their age” [5] – this map, and similarly modelled depictions of data, could prove to be an extremely useful tool in the demonstration and prediction of eventual progress towards a more aggregated future in terms of gendered development.
